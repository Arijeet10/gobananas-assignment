## GoBananas Frontend Developer Assignment

# Task Description:
Build a Simple React Application with API Integration and Material-UI.
You must build a single-page application that fetches data from a public API and displays it in a user-friendly format. The application should include:

```bash
•	A list view displaying items fetched from the API.
•	Basic navigation and styling using Material-UI.
•	A search feature to filter the displayed items.
```

# Requirements:
```bash
•	Use React.js to build the application.
•	Fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, OpenWeatherMap, or any other public API).
•	Implement the UI using Material-UI components.
•	Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
•	Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features.
•	Write clean, maintainable code with proper comments.
```

# Instructions:
```bash
1.	Setup: Create a React project using the Create React App.
2.	API Integration: Choose a public API and fetch data using fetch or axios.
3.	Display Data: Use Material-UI components to display the fetched data in a table or list.
4.	Search Functionality: Implement a search bar to filter the displayed items based on user input.
5.	Styling: Ensure the application is visually appealing and responsive.
```





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
